## Features

### Local Transcription
- **WhisperKit**: CoreML acceleration, 6 model sizes (39MB - 2.9GB)
- **Parakeet v3**: 25 European languages, daemon mode, auto-detection

### Technical Features
- Model preloading eliminates startup delays
- Daemon architecture for fast response times

## Legacy Features (Will Be Removed)
- **Window-based recording**: Recording window interface (disable "Express Mode" in settings)
- **Manual copy/paste workflow**: Use background mode instead
- **Cloud APIs**: OpenAI Whisper, Google Gemini (use local transcription instead)

## Requirements üìã
- macOS 14.0 (Sonoma) or later
- Swift 5.9+ (for building from source)

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è
### Option 1: Download Pre-built App
TBD

### Option 2: Build from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mazdak/FluidVoice.git
cd FluidVoice
source .build-config && fv-build
cp -r FluidVoice-dev.app /Applications/FluidVoice.app
```

## Setup üîß

### Local Transcription (Recommended)

**WhisperKit**
- No API key required
- Audio stays on your device
- CoreML hardware acceleration with Neural Engine
- 6 model sizes available (39MB to 2.9GB)
- Models download automatically on first use

**Parakeet v3**
- No API key required
- 25 European languages with automatic detection
- MLX framework optimized for Apple Silicon
- Daemon mode for fast response times
- ~600MB model downloads on setup
- Setup via "Download Parakeet v3 Model" in settings

### Legacy Cloud APIs
- OpenAI Whisper and Google Gemini are still available but will be removed
- Requires API keys and sends audio to external servers
- Use local transcription for better privacy and performance

## Usage üéØ

1. Press ‚åò‚áßSpace to start recording (background, no window)
2. Press ‚åò‚áßSpace again to stop and transcribe
3. Text appears directly in current application

The app lives in your menu bar - click the microphone icon for settings.

### Legacy Window Mode
If you disable "Express Mode" in settings, FluidVoice will use the old window-based interface. This mode will be removed in future versions.



## Privacy & Security üîí

- **Local Processing**: Audio stays on your device with WhisperKit and Parakeet
- **No Network Requests**: All transcription happens locally
- **No Tracking**: No usage data or analytics collected
- **Microphone Permission**: You'll be prompted once on first use
- **Open Source**: Full source code available for auditing
