# 2025-09-07 Session 02: Performance Optimization - Recording Latency Fix

**Date:** 2025-09-07  
**Session:** 02  
**Title:** Eliminated 300ms Recording Start Latency & Diagnosed Terminal Event Processing

## Main Accomplishment

‚úÖ **Fixed critical 300ms recording start bottleneck** - reduced recording startup from ~500ms to 53ms (89% improvement)

## Problem Description

User reported severe latency regression:
- Recording start: felt like 500ms instead of previous ~100ms  
- Post-recording: 500ms delay from hotkey-stop to text appearing on screen

## Root Cause Analysis

**Recording Start Bottleneck:**
- `AudioDeviceInspector.logSystemAudioDevices()` called in critical recording path
- **300ms blocking operation** doing triple redundant system queries:
  1. `logAllInputDevices()` - CoreAudio device enumeration 
  2. `logUserSelectedMicrophone()` - AVCaptureDevice discovery
  3. `findAudioDeviceIDForName()` - Second CoreAudio enumeration
- Pure debug logging with no functional purpose in hotkey path

**Post-Recording Latency:**
- FluidVoice processing actually **very fast: 118ms** (Stop ‚Üí Text completion)
- Real issue: **Terminal-specific event processing delay** in Ghostty
- Apple Notes shows **instant response** with same FluidVoice events

## Solution Implemented

**Fixed AudioRecorder.swift:179:**
```swift
// OLD (300ms bottleneck):
AudioDeviceInspector.logSystemAudioDevices()

// NEW (instant):
Logger.audioRecorder.infoDev("üîç Device validated and ready for recording")
```

## Performance Results

**Recording Start Latency:**
- Before: ~500ms (felt sluggish)
- After: **53ms** (feels snappy)
- Improvement: **89% faster**

**Complete Workflow Timing:**
```
Hotkey Stop ‚Üí Transcription ‚Üí Text Typed: 118ms
‚îú‚îÄ Transcription: 107ms (Parakeet)
‚îú‚îÄ Unicode Events: 11ms  
‚îî‚îÄ System propagation: varies by target app
```

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Recording performance fully restored**
‚úÖ **Critical path optimized** - no debug operations in hotkey flow
‚ö†Ô∏è **Terminal event latency** identified as separate system-level issue

## Root Learning

**Never put debug/logging operations in critical user-interaction paths.** A single `AudioDeviceInspector.logSystemAudioDevices()` call destroyed user experience with 300ms blocking I/O.

## Files Changed

- `Sources/AudioRecorder.swift` - Removed heavy debug inspection from recording start path

## Next Priorities

1. Consider making AudioDeviceInspector completely conditional on debug flag
2. Monitor if any other debug operations lurk in critical paths
3. Terminal event latency is external system issue (not FluidVoice problem)
