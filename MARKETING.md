# 4 • Hero Image / Magic Trick

**10-second demo:** Developer working in VS Code → holds FN → speaks "refactor this function to use async await and add proper error handling for network failures" → text appears instantly in Claude Code → AI refactors perfectly → developer speaks again "now add unit tests" → continues conversation naturally. Caption: "Finally. AI coding at the speed of thought."

# 11 • Testimonials / Results

"I'm shipping 3x more features. Not because AI writes more code, but because I can actually explain what I want at the speed I think it."
— **Senior Engineer, YC Startup**

"Claude Code + FluidVoice is insane. I describe the bug, the context, and my constraints in one breath. Claude nails it first try instead of the usual 5-prompt dance."
— **iOS Developer**

"My RSI was forcing me to retire. Now I'm more productive than ever. I architect with my voice, AI implements, I review and refine—all through conversation."
— **20-year veteran developer**

**Measured impact:**
- Average prompt length: 12 words (typing) → 73 words (speaking)
- Prompt iterations needed: 4.2 → 1.3
- Time to working code: 25 min → 8 min
- Daily AI interactions: 30 → 150+

# 15 • FAQs

**Q: Why is voice better for AI coding?**
A: You think in complete thoughts, not individual words. Voice captures your full intent—context, constraints, and goals—in one natural flow. AI understands better and needs fewer iterations.

**Q: Does it work with [specific AI tool]?**
A: If you can type in it, FluidVoice works with it. Claude Code, ChatGPT, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini, local LLMs—any text input field.

**Q: What about accuracy on technical terms?**
A: Exceptional. Trained on real developer-AI conversations. Knows the difference between "useState" and "use state", handles mixed case, preserves your speaking style.

**Q: Is it really 10x faster?**
A: For complex prompts, yes. Speaking 100+ words takes 30 seconds. Typing them takes 3-5 minutes. Plus you express ideas more naturally when speaking.

**Q: Why local processing?**
A: Zero latency. Your voice stream starts appearing in under 200ms. Cloud services add 500ms-2s delay, breaking your flow.

**Q: Is my code/voice data private?**
A: 100% local. We never see your audio, transcriptions, or what you're building. The AI service you're using handles your prompts as normal.

# 18 • Founder's Letter

I was burning out.

Not from coding—I still love that. But from the physical act of typing thousands of words to AI every day. Describing bugs. Explaining context. Iterating on prompts. My wrists were shot, my flow constantly broken.

Then I tried speaking my prompts. Everything changed.

Suddenly I could explain complex problems naturally. Give full context. Describe what I actually wanted. AI understood me better. I shipped faster. My wrists healed.

FluidVoice exists because voice is how humans are meant to communicate complex ideas. And when you're pair programming with AI, you're having a conversation—not writing an essay.

If you're tired of typing novels to AI just to get your ideas across, FluidVoice is for you.

Talk to AI like you'd talk to a senior colleague. Build at the speed of thought.

— Jonathan Glasmeyer
*Making AI coding feel like actual collaboration*

P.S. Try it for one day. Describe a complex refactor to Claude using your voice. You'll never go back to typing everything.
